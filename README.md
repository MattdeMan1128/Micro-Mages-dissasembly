# Micro-Mages-dissasembly
A work in progress for the 2019 NES Homebrew game, Micro Mages.
NOTICE: Requires MM.chr from Micro Mages.nes (or just a file ending with .chr, basically has the sprites/assets.) You can obtain this file with tniNES (MS-DOS program, can use DOSBox or something) or some Python files in other repositories, tniNES has worked best for me as I refused to use Python for something as simple as getting the graphics/assets file.
Does not currently support Second Quest, although it probably would just use MM.chr as Second Quest just seems like the same game with new levels.
